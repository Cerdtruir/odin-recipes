    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My beloved grilled cheese sandwich! It has 3 types of cheeses and a kick.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>4 slices whole wheat bread</li>
      <li>2 slices white American cheese</li>
      <li>4 thin slices tomato</li>
      <li>Â½ avocado, thinly sliced (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 slices provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat skillet on medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; add
        zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir
        zucchini mixture in the melted butter until most of the moisture has
        evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/2 tablespoon butter onto one side of each slice of bread to
        cover evenly. With buttered sides of the bread facing out, layer 1 slice
        American cheese, 2 slices tomato, and 2 slices avocado onto each of 2 of
        the bread slices. Sprinkle about half the basil, red pepper flakes, and
        garlic salt atop the avocado layer. Finish by topping each with half the
        mozzarella and 1 slice provolone. Top each with 1 of the remaining bread
        slices with the buttered side facing out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook in hot skillet until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, 3
        to 4 minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
