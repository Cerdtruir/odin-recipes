    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's very simple and great with fresh tomatoes for a summer night meal!
      Add shrimp or chicken for a heartier version of this pasta.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 zucchini, shredded</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, crumbled</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium
        heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes;
        drain water, reserving 1 cup pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; add
        zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir
        zucchini mixture in the melted butter until most of the moisture has
        evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
        onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, remaining 2
        cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper to onion; cook and stir, crushing
        tomatoes to desired consistency, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix fettuccine and zucchini mixture into onion mixture, adding as much
        reserved pasta water to keep pasta moist. Stir goat cheese and basil
        into pasta mixture.
      </li>
    </ol>
